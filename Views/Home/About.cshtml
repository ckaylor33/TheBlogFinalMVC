                    I built this blog for two main reasons: a learning tool to expand my knowledge skillset using C# and .NET on the backend, and to have a place to share some useful information for the likeminded Software Developers out there. You'll also find this blog on my Portfolio at: <a class="text-dark fw-bolder hover-underline-animation text-decoration-none" href="https://charliekaylor.com" target="_blank">https://charliekaylor.com</a>.

                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a highly motivated Software Developer, with a particular focus on C# and .NET to build high quality full stack applications. I absolutely love programming and development and am always eager to learn and improve my skillset within the field. 
                    During every build of a project I ensure optimal code and design (using seperation of concerns), efficiently resolve any issues that arise during this process by breaking down the problem into its' smaller parts, then using research if necessary to implement a working solution. 
                    Any successful build of an application comes from an initial understanding of what the application is supposed to be and do, then using that understanding to ensure the application is directly in line
                    with the target end product. While it's always great to exceed expectations for a project, this initial target/spec should be met first and foremost, with additional features added
                    after the application is fully functional (minimum viable product).
                    Through the use of effective communication, critical thinking, strategic planning and project management, applications can be built in a time efficient manner, in turn maximising
                    your results as a Software Developer. 
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, my focus has been to strategically learn the skills necessary to build full stack applications effectively and efficiently. 
                    This means a solid grounding in coding both the frontend and backend, with JS, HTML, CSS and Bootsrap5 on the frontend and C# with .NET and SQL on the backend. 
                    Prior to this, I am educated to degree level (Law &amp; Teaching), and have worked in recruitment, education and retail among others; 
                    bringing a large variety of skills to the table along with programming.

                <p>
                    As mentioned in the opening line at the top of the page, in building this blog I am hoping to document and share any knowledge, tips and tricks 
                    other software Developers may find useful. You'll also find some other topics I'm passionate about, including fitness/health & travel. You'll also see this blog evolve over
                    time as improvements are made to the site and new features added, with plans in place to add/improve: trending/popular posts, improved navigation to different categories, general
                    UI/UX improvements and possibly featured posts by guest authors.
                </p>
